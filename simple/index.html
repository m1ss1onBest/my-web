    <h2>Understand the structure of an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>A basic HTML document consists several key elements. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a sample paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The HTML page is made of <code>&lt;tags&gt;</code>, in this document there are such tags as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DOCTYPE</li>
        <li>html</li>
        <li>head</li>
        <li>meta</li>
        <li>title</li>
        <li>body</li>
        <li>h1</li>
        <li>p</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The document starts with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> part. This declaration tells the browser is HTML5 (html became popular when HTML5 came, in 2014. Now since browsers became smarter it doesn't make anything functional.</p>
